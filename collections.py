# List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
# Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.



# list
a= ["155","a",12,"arjun",12]
print(a)

print(b)

# set
